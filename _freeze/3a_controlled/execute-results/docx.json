Averaged across both years, we observed 66.5% of stems infested for high treatments and 47.3% of stems for low treatments. We found strong evidence suggesting that there was a significant difference between infestation at high and low treatment levels when holding year constant (P < 0.05, [Fig. 1](#fig1)).\n\nStem cutting by mature larvae, leading into winter, was observed at 5.7% for the high treatments and 3.9% for the low, giving us strong evidence for a difference in cutting between high and low treatment groups (P < 0.05). There was a dramatic decrease in survival observed from initial infestation to stem cutting. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nDissected stems often contained WSS larvae that had burrowed through multiple nodes. On average, infested stems showed 3.45 nodes of WSS damage. In the high treatment, 33.2% of these stems exhibited five or more nodes of visible damage, compared to 21.5% in the low treatment ([Fig. 2](#fig2)).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
