Initial infestation of *B. inermis* by WSS varied between collection sites, with the greatest infestation taking place within our three Big Sandy, MT sampling sites (2022: 86.3%, 2023: 67.7%), while in Moccasin we observed lower rates (2022: 56.2%, 2023: 51.6%). Across all sites and years in Big Sandy and Moccasin, we observed an average infestation of 57.6% within *B. inermis* and 45.3% within the adjacent wheat. Cutting by WSS was observed at an average rate of 3.72% in *B. inermis* and 47.1% in the adjacent cultivated wheat.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nTo generate a relative estimate of the number of potentially available WSS host larvae within *B. inermis* late in the growing season, we calculated the number of stems that contained at least four or more nodes with burrowing injury. In Big Sandy, 39.5% of collected stems in the fall exhibited at least 4 nodes of burrowing injury at our second sampling date. In Moccasin, the corresponding figure was 53.1% ([Fig. 7](#fig7)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nWe utilized the ratio of parasitized stems to cut stems to better understand the true impact of our *B. inermis* sink/source ecology for pest and natural enemy systems. The greatest ratio observed was found within *B. inermis* in Big Sandy, MT in the fall of 2022, where we observed a ratio of 16 parasitoids to a single WSS-cut stem. Thus, for every square meter of *B. inermis*, we would observe 16 stems that produced a parasitoid for every 1 stem that was likely to produce an adult WSS. The lowest ratio observed in our study was in adjacent wheat in Moccasin, 2022, where for every parasitoid, over nine WSS adults were found. All sample locations of *B. inermis* displayed positive ratios of parasitoids to cut stems, whereas adjacent wheat samples consistently showed negative ratios of parasitoids.

We observed a significant difference in parasitism observed between summer and fall collections (*estimate = -0.101, 95% CI: -0.137, -0.065*).  -->\n\nFall collection parasitism was consistently higher when compared to summer samples from the same sites. We have strong evidence (P < 0.05*) to suggest that parasitism within our fall collections is greater than parasitism rates from our summer collections when considering sample site and year ([Fig. 9](#fig9)). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
