Bracon cephi and B. lissogaster are native WSS parasitoids important in managing WSS outbreaks and damage. Smooth Bromegrass (Bromus inermis) grass has been found to be an effective parasitoid sink, and potential trap crop, when grown in areas surrounding wheat fields in Montana. As climate changes continue to alter central and northern Montana, WSS will continue to cause immense damage to dry-land cereal crop yields. We analyzed both local temperature and precipitation trends at our sample sites, and found statistically significant increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation over the past fifty years. Our study observes the utilization of smooth brome in providing year-over-year host refuge for Bracon spp parasitoids. We measured the WSS larval infestation and survival rate within controlled smooth brome plots, observing a maximum infestation of 66.5% and a maximum end-of-year survival of 5.7%. We also collected stems from sites in central and northern Montana where we measured the WSS infestation and parasitoid prevalence within cultivated wheat and adjacent smooth brome. Montana fields sites showed high levels of C. cinctus infestation within both B. inermis and adjacent wheat crop in Big Sandy (64.5% B. inermis, 65.7% adjacent wheat) and Moccasin (50.6%, 38.6%). We observed high year-end WSS larval mortality measured as stem cutting of infested stems with B. inermis when compared to adjacent wheat in Big Sandy (2.9% B. inermis, 46.5% adjacent wheat) and Moccasin (6.4%, 49.4%). Infested stems exhibited parasitism in both Big Sandy (7.11% B. inermis, 8.6% adjacent wheat) and Moccasin (6.11%, 2.09%). This research underlines the importance of providing a sustainable ecological buffer for WSS parasitoids as climate conditions continue to change.\nKeywords\nParasitoids, integrated pest management, biocontrol, habitat, conservation",

    "text": "Ecologists and farmers frequently hold divergent views regarding the importance of natural habitats within agricultural landscapes, a distinction often overlooked in ecological and conservation discourse (Tscharntke et al. 2016). While ecologists recognize the role of natural habitats such as field border vegetation in supporting biodiversity and providing potential ecosystem services like biological pest control, many farmers perceive these semi-arid habitat remnants as occupying valuable cropland or even as sources of pests. As such, documenting how pest and natural enemy populations interact with agricultural landscapes alongside semi-natural habitat buffers on the crop periphery is important in determining the degree of the services or disservices provided.\nNumerous polyphagous insect herbivores and their natural enemies rely on a variety of resources found across diverse habitat types within their environment. Depending upon the quality of the resource, different habitat types can serve as sources for increased pest or natural enemy populations. Similarly, these habitat types can serve as sinks that decrease populations (Kennedy and Storer 2000). Altering the presence of these resources can have impacts on pest or natural enemy populations and can alter the ecology between the examined species. For example, diversifying the edge cropping of organic Brassica using fava beans, fennel, and marigolds results in a diversity in beneficial arthropod communities that help reduce phytophagous herbivory (Morais et al. 2023).\nUnderstanding the ways in which landscape habitat diversity impacts the ecological relationship between pest and enemy is crucial for effectively managing pest species in large scale cropping systems. Similarly, understanding how herbivore plant-hosts act as reservoirs for pests or beneficial natural enemies can potentially play a role in stabilizing year-over-year agricultural impact from these pests (Cano et al. 2022).\nThe wheat stem sawfly (WSS), Hymenoptera Cephus cinctus Norton, is a grass-mining sawfly native to North America [Criddle (1922); Ainslie1929; Wallace and McNeal (1966); Lesieur et al. (2016)]. Originally adept at utilizing wild grass hosts, the species became a major pest to cultivated cereals as this resource became more prevalent following European settlement, becoming a notable pest of winter wheat in 1990 in Montana (Morrill and Kushnak 1996), and more recently in Colorado (Cockrell et al. 2021). Climate warming has the potential to further expand the range of this pest both northward and southward (Olfert et al. 2019, Weaver 2023). Adult female WSS use their saw-like ovipositor to lay their eggs in the lumen of stems, where the eggs hatch, leading to larval feeding of parenchyma tissue [Roemhild1954; Holmes and Farstad (1956)]. Economic damage manifests in the form of both kernel weight reduction caused by tissue damage [Beres et al. (2011); Delaney2010] and stem toppling due to late-season larval girdling (Holmes and Peterson 1960, Nansen et al. 2005, McCullough et al. 2020).\nSeveral parasitoid or predatory species attack C. cinctus within wild grass hosts Morrill et al. (2001), however, two species, Bracon cephis (Gahan) and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), have been observed targeting WSS within cultivated cereals (Nelson and Farstad 1953, Morrill et al. 1998, Runyon et al. 2001, Runyon 2001). These two host-specific ectoparasitoids are native to North America. Both parasitoids are bivoltine, with the first generation present in Montana from late-June to late-July, while the second generation is active from mid-July to September (Gahan 1918, Somsen and Luginbill 1956, Davis 2013). Adult female B. cephi and B. lissogaster inject a paralytic toxin into a C. cinctus larvae within the host stem, paralyzing the host larvae, and depositing from a single (B. cephi) to 1-3 (B. lissogaster) eggs. B. cephi and B. lissogaster have been shown to provide biological control via irreplaceable mortality of C. cinctus populations (Peterson et al. 2011, Buteler et al. 2015) and can significantly reduce C. cinctus damage and impact on crop yields (Buteler et al. 2008, Bekkerman and Weaver 2018, Adhikari et al. 2019, Rand et al. 2020). While C. cinctus has a wide range of viable host plants, including native and non-native grasses and cultivated row-crops such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) (Wallace and McNeal 1966, Cockrell et al. 2017, Achhami et al. 2020), infestation levels can vary widely across hosts. Previous research has shown preference for host plants with larger stem diameter (Ainslie 1920, Buteler et al. 2009, Bhandari 2020).\nRecent research has shown natural non-cultivated grasses such as Agropyron cristatum, Bromus techtorum, Bromus inermis, Elymus trachycaulus, and Thinopyrum intermedium host C. cinctus and most also host Bracon spp. parasitoids quite well (Perez-Mendoza and Weaver 2006, Peirce et al. 2021, Rand et al. 2024). We find investigating B. inermis holds the most potential, as it has been shown to be a quality initially-accepted host for C. cinctus oviposition while also leading to high larval mortality later on (Seamans 1928, Farstad and Jacobson 1945). However, there is a lack of detailed relating to the total infestation, cutting, and parasitism within B. inermis at multiple time points throughout the growing season. Quantitative assessment of potential ‘reservoir’ characteristics and local spatial information could prove useful in fully understanding the ecological impacts of maintaining B. inermis along roadways and within coulees.\nSmooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss) is a Eurasian cool-season rhizomatous grass introduced to the United States in 1884 (Salesman and Thomsen 2011).B. inermis was originally thought of as potentially useful as a trap crop in order to combat the growing WSS problem with cultural control practices (Criddle 1922, Seamans 1928, Farstad and Jacobson 1945, Beres et al. 2011). Due to its low agricultural value, and propensity to form monocultures and out compete many native grasses, B. inermis is categorized as invasive in some habitats (Carlson and Newell 1985, Willson and Stubbendieck 2000, Dillemuth et al. 2008). However, B. inermis still holds considerable ecological and potential economic value due to its late senescence and WSS antibiosis properties (Otfinowski et al. 2006, Rand et al. 2024).\nMontana’s golden triangle, an area of central and northern Montana with intense cereal grain production, is prone to drought and burning via wildfire (Wilson 1923, Adhikari et al. 2019). As both C. cinctus and its host-specific parasitoids are relatively restricted in their annual mobility (Weaver et al. 2005), environmental extremes can have broad impacts on both local pest and natural enemy populations. As with many predator-prey interactions, the C. cinctus and parasitoid populations fluctuate, with crashes and spikes experienced in close succession and through ineteraction with drought (Holmes et al. 1963, Holmes 1982). Similar examples of these classical population dynamics patterns can be found in wolves and moose on Isle Royale (Peterson 1999), and Coccinellidae and aphids (Evans 1999), among others.\nWe examined historical weather data from two field locations (10 sites overall) in central and northern Montana. We used this data to understand how changes in global climate trends may be impacting C. cinctus, B. cephi and B. lissogaster interact with B. inermis populations. In addition we analyzed normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) at our field sites to understand how B. inermis senescence patterns compare to adjacent cultivated wheat fields.\nIn this study, we explored the ecological patterns between Montana populations of C. cinctus and its associated braconid parasitoids in relation to B. inermis host sites. Our goal, was 1) to understand the degree to which C. cinctus infested B. inermis stems in relation to neighboring cereal crops, and 2) the way in which braconid parasitoids utilized WSS hosts available within B. inermis stems. To do so, we conducted two separate studies. In our first study, we conducted controlled C. cinctus infestation of B. inermis to understand the relative infestation and cutting rate of C. cinctus within the B. inermis stems in the absence of parasitoids. The second study examined rates of cutting and parasitism in wheat crops and their surroundings at field sites in central and northern Montana.\nUsing these studies, we addressed three questions, 1) what is the total C. cinctus-caused stem cutting heading into overwinter - and thus the source rate, of the subsequent C. cinctus population in B. inermis? 2) can C. cinctus larvae within B. inermis serve as critical second generation hosts for B. cephi and B. lissogaster? and 3) how do annual C. cinctus and parasitoid populations in B. inermis compare with those in the adjacent cultivated wheat fields?\n\n\n\n\nAchhami BB, Reddy GVP, Sherman JD, et al. 2020.

As needed, stubs were removed from refrigeration and kept at 22-27°C for 4-5 weeks inside of 100 oz GladWare® storage containers (Glad®, Oakland, California USA). Once B. inermis stems reached six inches tall, stub containers with emerging sawflies were added to cages to mimic sawfly infestation pressure. Sawfly quantity treatments were as follows: high (600 stubs), low (200 stubs), and control (0 stubs).\nData Collection. In late August, B. inermis stems were collected from each cage.

Data for each field site was averaged from three of the closest weather stations to that location.\nTo better understand how precipitation patterns vary throughout the growing season, we looked at local daily precipitation totals from weather stations at our sampling sites in Big Sandy and Moccasin, MT. Data was pulled online from historical WeatherUnderground weather station data (Company 2024). Precipitation readings were broken into two categories - dates before July 15 and after September 15, as well as between July 15 and September 15. These dates were chosen based on typical wheat harvest and historical periods of known Bracon spp activity. In the ‘Golden Triangle’, typical spring wheat harvest takes place in mid-July on average (Wilson 1923, Zhu and Burney 2021).\nWe used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to compare the relative greening throughout the growing season between wheat fields and adjacent B. inermis (fig. 2). NDVI is typically used to assess vegetation health and density, and is calculated from the visible and near-infrared light reflected by vegetation (Pettorelli et al. 2005). NDVI data measurements were directly downloaded using Google Earth Engine (Google Inc. 2023, Mountain View, CA, USA).\nStem collection and processing. We conducted a field survey to assess C. cinctus infestation, larval mortality, and B. cephi and B. lissogaster prevalence within B. inermis and adjacent wheat fields. Samples were collected from wheat fields and adjacent B. inermis in early July and late August in 2022, and 2023 from sites in Big Sandy and Moccasin MT, USA. Sampling sites were set up as 100\\(m^2\\) polygons along the edge of adjoining wheat fields. Four collection squares of 1ft x 1ft were randomly selected within each polygon during both collection events each year. All stems within each 1 x 1 ft square were collected using a shovel to remove both stem and root material. Wheat stems were collected at distances of 5 and 20 meters from the edge of the field. Samples were collected in 4 rows at 10 meters apart. 2 samples were collected in each row at distances of 5 and 20 meters. 1 ft samples were collected at each point.\nWheat and B. inermis stems were then returned to Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana and stored in a 10°C cold, humid storage until dissection. Stems were dissected in the same manner as samples from our controlled experiment. We recorded presence or absence of C. cinctus larval infestation, live eggs, dead eggs, dead larvae, live larvae and parasitism, in addition to stem cutting. Sawfly larvae were identified based on descriptions in Criddle (1915) and Wallace and McNeal (1996).\nTo better understand the densities of host C. cinctus and the Bracon spp. within the wheat and adjacent B. inermis at each sampling site, we converted our units to the ratio of parasitoids to surviving hosts stem per unit area. Densities of stems are different when considering semi-natural, long-standing stands of B. inermis and the adjacent cultivated wheat or barley.",

Weather data was analyzed using either average yearly precipitation (inches) or average yearly temperature (°C) as the response variable and year as the predictor. Similar to our weather data analysis, NDVI data was linear modeled to discern differences in NDVI measurements over time.\nWe used generalized linear mixed models with binomial errors (logit link) fit using bound optimization by quadratic approximation, with a maximum of 200,000 iterations, were run in the lme4 package in R (Bates et al. 2015) to examine the effects of location and year (fixed effects) on each of the three response variables: proportion of stems infested, proportion of stems cut, and proportion of stems parasitized by Bracon spp.",

    "text": "Controlled C. cinctus Infestation of B. inermis\n\nC. cinctus heavily infested stems of B. inermis in the controlled test conditions. Averaged across both years, we observed 66.5% of stems infested for high treatments and 47.3% of stems for low treatments. We found strong evidence suggesting that there was a significant difference between infestation at high and low treatment levels when holding year constant (r = 0.83, P &lt; 0.05, Fig. 3).\nStem cutting by mature larvae, leading into winter, was observed at 5.7% for the high treatments and 3.9% for the low, showing strong evidence for a difference in cutting between high and low treatment groups (r = 0.592, P &lt; 0.05). There was a dramatic decrease in survival observed from initial infestation to stem cutting.\nC. cinctus infested stems often contained larvae burrowing through multiple nodes. In 2022, 64.3% of stems were observed to have at least 4 nodes burrowed through, or 5 internodes occupied. In 2023, 61.7% of stems had at least 4 nodes infested Fig. 4\nMontana Field Sites\nHistorical Weather Analysis & NDVI\nIn both Big Sandy and Moccasin, MT, we observed a decrease in average yearly precipitation and increase in average yearly temperature. We observed a significant linear relationship (r = 0.1, P = 0.033, estimate = -0.058) between average precipitation and year for both Big Sandy and Moccasin, Montana. For each location and one-year increase, we observed a 0.05 inch decrease in precipitation. (Fig. 5). Additionally, we observed a significant positive linear relationship (r = 0.245, P &lt; 0.05, estimate = 0.028) between year and average yearly temperature for Moccasin and Big Sandy, MT. Thus, each year, the average daily temperature has increased by 0.03°C. (Fig. 6). Analyzing local, precipitation data over the past five years yielded information on how central and northern Montana experience relative dryness during the late-summer months. In Big Sandy, when controlling for year, we saw strong evidence of a significant difference (p&lt;0.05, F=2.067, fig. 7) between daily rainfall in months prior July 15 and after September 15 compared to days within the July 15 to September 15 ‘late-summer’ period. Analysis of Moccain precipitation data revealed that there is little evidence (p=0.08, F=1.535) to suggest a difference between the two date categories.\nWe observed a notable difference in NDVI when comparing adjacent B. inermis and spring wheat. We saw a significant difference in the B. inermis post-July 15 NDVI (0.846, P&lt;0.05) when compared to the post-July 15 NDVI of the adjacent wheat crop. The B. inermis NDVI remained relatively linear in it’s downslope compared to the wheat field (Fig. 7).\nField Site Samples\nWe quantified C. cinctus and Bracon spp. parasitoid presence in 6,148 wheat and grass stems across 10 research sites in 2022 and 2023. Initial infestation of B. inermis by C. cinctus varied between collection sites, with the greatest infestation taking place within our three Big Sandy, MT sampling sites (2023: 65.4%, 2022: 63.1%), while the lowest infestation observed was in Moccasin, MT (2023: 40.8%, 2022: 60.7%). Across all sites in Big Sandy and Moccasin, we observed an average infestation of 57.5% within B. inermis and 47.6% within the adjacent wheat. Cutting by C. cintus was observed at an average rate of 5.59% in B. inermis and 47.1% in the adjacent cultivated wheat (Fig. 8.\nTo generate a relative estimate of the number of available C. cinctus host larvae within B. inermis late in the growing season, we calculated the number of stems that contained at least four or more nodes with burrowing injury. In Big Sandy, 76.2% of collected stems in the fall exhibited at least 4 nodes of burrowing injury at our second sampling date. In Moccasin, the corresponding figure was 66.5% (Fig. 9).\nWe utilized the ratio of parasitized stems to cut stems to better understand the true impact of our B. inermis sink/source ecology. The largest ratio observed was in Big Sandy, MT in the fall of 2022, where we observed a ratio of 16 parasitoids to a single C. cinctus-cut stem. Thus, for every square meter of B. inermis, we would observe 16 stems that produced a parasitoid for every 1 stem that was likely to produce an adult C. cinctus. All other sample locations also showed positive ratios of parasitoids to cut stems (Fig. 10).\nTo understand the seasonal trends of Bracon spp use of potential C. cinctus hosts within B. inermis, we collected stem samples twice each growing season. We collected one pre-harvest, in July, and a second time in September, after all adult Bracon spp would be dead. We observed a significant difference (df = 96, r = 0.304, p &lt; 0.05) between parasitoid presence in infested stems collected in Big Sandy and Moccasin, MT.\nI want to drive home that stems with 3 + nodes infested likely had larave that were alive late into the summer. Compare the number of nodes infested in the summer to stems that have 3+ infested in the fall.",

    "text": "Discussion\nAssessment of C. cicntus infestation and larval mortality within B. inermis from out controlled infestation survey showed high infestation coupled with high larval mortality prior to overwintering diapause. Even in cases of high infestation (70%+), larval survival to cutting topped out around around 15%, pointing towards B. inermis’ ability to serve as a quality sink for C. cinctus larvae. These results confirm the assertions by Criddle (1992) and Seamans (1928) that B. inermis can serve as a quality C. cinctus trap crop. In addition to high larval mortality, stem dissection exhibited high numbers of stems with over four internodes burrowed through by C. cinctus larvae. Larval movement through stems can be quick in the case of susceptible cultivated cereal grains (Criddle 1923). However, B. inermis, given it’s presumed antibiosis properties, leads to slower larval development and thus movement through the stem. We found several B.inermis stems with living larvae as late as late-September.\nAs the climate of central and northern Montana continues to change, wheat stem sawfly infestation will continue to impact cereal crop yields. Precipitation and temperature data from our sampling sites underscores the importance of continuing to monitor and conserve areas of semi-natural grassland. 50-year trends analyzed in this study show similar results to Pederson et al (2009) in which the dry-land agricultural environments found in central and northern Montana are likely to continue to become hotter and dryer on average. Over the past fifty years, precipitation in Big Sandy has decreased by an average of 0.05 inches per year. Given the trend continues, by 2050 the area could experience an inch less of rain per year.\nBoth average precipitation and average temperatures vary widely between years as the region goes through many droughts and periods of relative high rainfall (Pederson et al. 2009, Company 2024). Shown in our analysis of daily measurements over the past five years, precipitation significantly decreases during the period after wheat harvest, July 15 - September15, a period when second generation Bracon adults are searching for C. cinctus larval hosts. Mid-season senesence of many C. cinctus host plants can then leave Bracon parasitoids with little resources for\nProlonged drought, like seen in 2021 in Big Sandy, MT, can cause a dearth of green host plants in these semi-arid environments that can be problimatic for second generation adult parasitoids.\nGiven our analysis of NDVI at our sampling sites, it is clear that B. inermis is capable of continued late seasonal greening and may provide important resources for Bracon spp parasitoids in years of drought or crop failure. It is these buffer zones where parasitoids may be able to find C. cinctus larvae in numbers great enough to prevent the larger population crashes that can lead large localized increases in C. cinctus populations and damage (Holmes 1982).\nAnalysis of larval C. cinctus infestation of B. inermis and adjacent winter wheat reveal similar results to our controlled B. inermis infestation in Bozeman. We found B. inermis infestation to be similar to that of neighboring wheat fields, making it likely that C. cinctus pressures B. inermis similarly to cultivated wheat.",

    "text": "Still working on adding some citations and information discussing Rand & Peirce papers and how my findings are similar and different. I collected samples twice throughout the year so got a bigger picture of how parasitism changes for each generation. It is looking like parasitism in the fall collections is much higher in the brome compared to the summer collections. Interesting!\n\n\nMontana Field Site Survey\nAnalysis of weather trends in Big Sandy and Moccasin, MT confirmed that the patterns in central and northern Montana are changing towards warmer and drier conditions (Pederson et al. 2009). We observed an average decrease in 0.058 inches of precipitation per year since 1975, while since 1950, temperatures have experienced an average yearly increase of 0.028°C. These changes in precipitation and temperature can have significant impacts on timing of crop production and harvest timing (Zhu and Burney 2021). Year-over-year populations of the Bracon spp parasitoids are particularly sensitive, as their bivoltine nature requires the second yearly generation to find a suitable C. cinctus host (Nelson and Farstad 1953, Runyon et al. 2002). NDVI analyses exhibited the prolonged senescence period for B. inermis when compared to adjacent cultivated wheat. C. cinctus larvae are cued via the thinning of the cell membranes (Villacorta et al. 1971) during plant senescence to travel to the base of the stem and prepare for obligatory diapause (Beres et al. 2011). Because B. inermis senescence occurs at slower rates compared to wheat or barley, C. cinctus may remain within the stem later in into the summer and fall, providing potential host larvae for second generation Bracon parasitoids.\nPrevious research has shown B. inermis to be a quality host of both C. cinctus and Bracon spp parasitoids (Criddle 1922, Peirce et al. 2021, Rand et al. 2024), but little data is available on the season fluctuation of B. inermis utilization (Criddle 1922, Peirce et al. 2021, Rand et al. 2024). Because we collected stem samples twice during the growing season, we were able to compare levels of parasitism. We hoped to understand how parasitism rates changed from July (pre-wheat harvest) and September (post-wheat harvest) of each year.\nOur results showed that parasitoid presence increase significantly at all sites between pre- and post-harvest collections. Given the collection methods, September collection parasitism was inherently a combination of both pre-harvest and post-harvest activity. While we cannot ascertain Bracon preference for host stems, we can assess that the parasitoids utilize infested B. inermis stems post-harvest when C. cinctus is no longer available within wheat stems.\nAdditionally, we observed a high number of stems exhibiting levels of C. cinctus damage that point to prolonged larval presence within B. inermis stems. In Big Sandy (76.2%) and Moccasin (66.5%), stems that exhibited four or more nodes burrowed suggests that C. cinctus larvae remain available within B. inermis stems past wheat harvest, when they are more limited in availability. Most importantly, in years of drought or increased temperatures where wheat senescence and harvest may occur earlier in the summer.\nWe utilized parasitism to cut stem ratios to understand the relative impact of B. inermis host sources on overall field parasitism. Assessing overall numbers of insects can potentially diminish the apparent importance of B. inermis, as per square meter stem counts in cultivated wheat are denser than B. inermis counts within coulees and along roadsides B. inermis. Our findings of significantly greater ratios of parasitized stems to cut stems within B. inermis when compared to adjacent when indicates these field-side areas provide greater parasitoid source per square meter when compared to cultivated fields. This emphasizes the significance of accounting for habitat diversity to sustain parasitoid populations over successive years, as well as recognizing the crucial role of edge-row areas in maximizing parasitoid effectiveness in minimizing C. cinctus damage.\n\n\nOld Discussion Text\nC. cinctus mortality was found to be high in controlled B. inermis infestation trials. Our results build upon other studies where B. inermis infestation confirmed previously reported high C. cinctus larval mortality prior to overwintering (Shanower and Hoelmer 2004, Perez-Mendoza and Weaver 2006, Buteler et al. 2008). Of those infested stems, a large proportion exhibited larval damage in at least 5 internodes (62.5%). While the timing of stem collection and dissection did not align with precise measurement of living larvae (stems dissected in October), we can assert that stems with at least 4 nodes burrowed through would have a high probability of containing large, live larvae, and thus a viable potential parasitoid host, in late July and August of the same year.\nWhile total and per node B inermis infestation by C. cinctus was high, survival to overwintering (cutting) only occurred in 5.7% of C. cinctus infested stems. Our results indicate that B. inermis serves as a high-quality host for C. cinctus larvae during the spring and summer months. However, there was minimal survival of C. cinctus larvae beyond August and September, confirming that there will be little adult emergence from B. inermis the following season.\nAssessing the comparative abundance of C. cinctus and its associated parasitoids within B. inermis and adjacent cultivated cereal hosts is an important initial step in evaluating whether semi-natural environments within road-side or coulee areas serve as sink or source origins of the pest and its beneficial natural adversaries infiltrating agricultural crops.",
