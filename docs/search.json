I live in Bozeman, MT with my wife Grace.\nMy Research Interests\nI am broadly interested in how insects impact the lives of humans and how we can better utilize them to positively impact modern issues such as crop yield, climate change, and waste management.\nMontana State University - MSc Entomology\nMy research focuses on understanding how the ecological relationship between the wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus) and two native biocontrol parasitoids (Bracon cephi and Bracon lissogaster) are impacted by smooth brome (Bromis inermis). My project includes field sites in southwest, central, and northern Montana, as well as volatile organic compound analysis of greenhouse-grown smooth brome and winter wheat.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Image Gallery\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  View my CV"
